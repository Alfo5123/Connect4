# Connect4
Monte Carlo Tree Search Based AI Connect 4 Bot

## Getting Started

### About the game

Connect 4 is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

It must be noted that although this is a solved game (the first player can always win with right moves), the purpose of this project was to implement the algorithm and test its performance in a simple game. We encourage users to find those right moves!

### The algorithm

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Running the game

### Prerequisites

The code was written in Python 2.7.13. In order to display the game's GUI, we used [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html) module, which is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Although you don't need to download Tkinter since it is an integral part of all Python distributions. In any case, you can find more details about Tkinter installation [here](http://ftp.ntua.gr/mirror/python/topics/tkinter/download.html).

### Run
It is as simple as one

```
python game.py
```


Have fun!
